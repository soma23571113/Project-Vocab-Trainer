"""VOCABULARY-TRAINER

Do this before starting the program:
Save the vocabulary file there, where you have your program saved as well
Name your vocabulary file vocabulary.txt. If you don't want to have this name, change the name in line 16
When writing your vocabulary file, separate the word and the translation with ' % '
