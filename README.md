Sooo basically.. We have to do a project at school - must be in the terminal - and this is mine. I also thought it was a great opportunity to test out github so ik 
how to use it later when developing bigger projects. So basically this is a vocabulary trainer where you write your vocabulary into a file and it asks you those
vocabulary. And it also saves your progress for later, so that you can freely close the window. Thats it :)
